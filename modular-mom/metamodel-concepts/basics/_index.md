These are the [Module MOM Matamodel](/modular-mom/metamodel-concepts/)  basics:

### The Basics 

Modular MOM Metamodel is inspired from the architecture & Metamodel of Opcenter Ex Core. The salient features of the Modular MOM Metamodel are: 

- **Object-Oriented**: Enables the definition of metadata that adheres to the OO principles, such as Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance & Polymorphism
- **Imperative**: The logic definition adheres to the imperative programming paradigm
- **Strongly Typed**: Provides a Strong Type System for the primary components of the Metadata, but it also allows for some **dynamic** types to be used in the logic definitions 
- **Relational**: Enables the definition of an Object Model which is based on Relational Model and supports relationships like Association, Composition & Aggregation 
- **Aspect-Oriented**: Enables adding of cross-cutting functionality based on annotations like in an aspect-oriented programming paradigm 
- **Persistence**: Enables configurable Object-Relational Mapping based persistence mechanism for the user data

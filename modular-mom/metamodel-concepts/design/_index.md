This is the [Module MOM Platform](/modular-mom-metamodel/) design:

The Design 

The ‘Configurable Object’ forms the core of the Metamodel design. Since the Metadata adheres to the OO principles, a ‘Class or Object Type’ that describes an ‘object instance’ becomes the central idea of the Metadata, and, the ‘Configurable Object’ enables the 

creation of these ‘Classes’ or ‘Object Types’. Applying the Metadata Abstraction level concepts from the ‘The OMG Group’, the ‘Configurable Object’ represents an instance at M2 level, that means that the instances of the ‘Configurable Objects’ represent the instance at M1 level, which, form the ‘type’ definitions for the object instances at M0 level - the actual instance data.
